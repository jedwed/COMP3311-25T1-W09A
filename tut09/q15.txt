Consider the schema R and set of fds F
R  =  ABCDEFGH
F  =  { ABH → C,  A → DE,  BGH → F,  F → ADH,  BH → GE }
Produce a BCNF decomposition of R.

Candidate keys:
B does not appear on RHS, must be part of candidate key
B+ = {B}

Try BH+ = {B, H, G, E, F, A, D, C}

Step: Decompose relation R(ABCDEFGH)
ABH -> C
1. ABH -> C is NOT trivial
2. ABH is a superkey
hence ABC -> C meets the requirements

A -> DE
1. A -> DE is not trivial
2. A is not a superkey
Hence, A -> DE does NOT meet the requirements
Decompose R(ABCDEFGH) into R1(ABCFGH) and R2(ADE)

Attempt to decompose R1(ABCFGH), F = {ABH -> C, BGH -> F, F -> AH, BH -> GE}
ABH -> C
1. ABH -> C is not trivial
2. ABH+ = {A, B, H, G, E, F, C}, ABH is a superkey

BHG -> F
1. BGH -> F is not trivial
2. BHG is a superkey

F -> AH
1. F -> AH is not trivial
2. F is NOT a superkey
Hence F -> AH does NOT meet the requirements
Decompose R1(ABCFGH) into R3(BCFG) and R4(FAH)

Attempt to decompose R2(ADE), F = { A -> DE }
A -> DE
1. A -> DE is not trivial
2. A is a superkey
Hence, R2 is in BCNF, no decomposition needed

Attempt to decompose R3(BCFG), F = {}
R3 is in BCNF, no decomposition needed

Attempt to decompose R4(FAH), F = {F -> AH}
F -> AH
1. F -> AH is not trivial
2. F is a superkey
Hence, R4 is in BCNF, no decomposition needed

Final schema: R2(ADE), R3(BCFG), R4(FAH)
