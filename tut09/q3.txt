Consider the relation R(A,B,C,D,E) and the  
set of functional dependencies 
F = { A → B, BC → E, ED → A }

a. List all of the candidate keys for R.
Attributes that don't appear on the RHS of any fds MUST be part of the candidate key
CD does not appear on the RHS of any fds, hence they must be part of the primary key
CD+ = {C, D}
CD is not a candidate key

Try adding attribute A to CD
ACD+ = {A, C, D, B, E}
Hence ACD is a candidate key

Try adding B to CD
BCD+ = {B, C, D, E, A}
BCD is also a candidate key

Try adding E to CD
ECD+ = {E, C, D, A, B}
ECD is a candidate key

Hence, ACD, BCD and CDE are our candidate keys

b. Is R in third normal form (3NF)?
R(A,B,C,D,E)
F = { A → B, BC → E, ED → A }
ACD, BCD and CDE are candidate keys

Loop through all fds in F
A -> B
1. A -> B is not trivial
2. A is not a superkey
3. B is a single attribute and part of candidate key BCD
Hence, fd A -> B meets the requirements

BC -> E
1. BC -> E is not trivial
2. BC is not a superkey
3. E is a single attribute and part of candidate key CDE

ED -> A
1. ED -> A is not trivial
2. ED is not a superkey
3. A is a single attribute and part of candidate key ACD

Conclusion, R is in 3NF because the conditions hold for all fds

c. Is R in Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)?

R(A,B,C,D,E)
F = { A → B, BC → E, ED → A }
ACD, BCD and CDE are candidate keys

Loop through all fds in F
A -> B
1. A -> B is not trivial
2. A is not a superkey
Hence, fd A -> B does not meet the requirements

Therefore, R is not in BCNF
