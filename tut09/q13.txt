Compute a minimal cover for:
F   =   { B → A,  D → A,  AB → D } 

Step 1: Convert to canonical form
All RHS are single attribute, F is already in canonical form

Step 2: Reduce LHS, remove redundant dependent attributes
Consider AB -> D, see if you can reduce it to A -> D or B -> D

1. B -> A
2. B -> AB (Augmentation of 1)
3. AB -> D (Given from F)
4. B -> D (Transitivity using 2 and 3)

Hence, we can replace AB -> D with B -> D

F = {B -> A, D -> A, B -> D}

Step 3: Remove redundant fds
We can derive B -> A from transitivity using B -> D and D -> A, hence it is redundant

Minimal cover Fc = {D -> A, B -> D}
