Attributes
acct# - unique account indentifier
branch# - unique branch identifier
tfn - unique customer identifier (tax file number)
kind - type of account (savings, cheque, ...)
balance - amount of money in account
city - city where branch is located
name - customer's name

Unnormalised relation R(acct#, branch#, tfn, kind, balance, city, name)

Each account is held at a specific branch, 
but a customer may hold more than one account 
and an account may have more than one associated customer.

Q: Derive set of fds
acct# -> branch#, balance, kind
branch# -> city
tfn -> name

Candidate key = {acct#, tfn}

Q: Normalise the relation into 3NF
First step: find minimal cover
Set of fds is already in minimal cover

Second step: flatten
Accounts(acct#, branch#, balance, kind)
Branches(branch#, city)
Persons(tfn, name)

Third step: no created relation contains candidate key attributes
Create table:
Owns(acct#, tfn)

Final normalised 3NF schema:

Accounts(acct#, branch#, balance, kind)
Branches(branch#, city)
Persons(tfn, name)
Owns(acct#, tfn)
