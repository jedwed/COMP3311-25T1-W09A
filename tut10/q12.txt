T1: R(X) R(Y) W(X)           W(X)
T2:                R(Y)           R(Y)
T3:                     W(Y)

a. Determine (by using a precedence graph) whether 
the schedule is conflict-serializable

Draw a precedence graph
T1 -> T3 (T1 R(Y) before T3 W(Y))
T2 -> T3 (T3 R(Y) before T3 W(Y))
T3 -> T2 (T3 W(Y) before T2 R(Y))

There exists a cyclic dependence between T2 and T3
Therefore, the schedule is not conflict serializable
